The React Investment Calculator is a powerful financial tool created using React, JavaScript, and CSS. It empowers users to plan their investments with precision, allowing them to input essential financial details and receive comprehensive projections.

  2. Yearly Projections: The calculator provides a clear breakdown of projected financial milestones on a yearly basis. Users can track their total savings at the end of each year, the interest gained in a specific year, the cumulative interest earned over time, and the total invested capital.
